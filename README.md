## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an interesting exercise. I wanted to create a certain functionality depending if they where in mobile or desktop. I tried a couple of things and was able to learn how to make javascript work if it matches certain width. Still was not able to create what I wanted. I need to keep practicing that.

### Continued development

I want to get a little bit more knowledge of animations. Right now I've been taking all the time to understand functionality (witch is good) but I want to make it look good as well.

> I just realized that the way the shareCard is disappearing is not the optimal way. As soon as it is hiding it goes to the back I need to make it go to the back as soon as the animation finishes.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter/) -This is a pretty good resource since it helps add the color that you want for your svg and it will give you the filter that you need to add.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45947570/how-to-attach-an-event-listener-to-the-dom-depending-upon-the-screen-size) - Here is where I found a way to make different behavior depending on the screen size, I was felling very comfortable that this was going to work and I'm still thinking that this will work. I just need to keep practicing and hopefully the next try will work.
